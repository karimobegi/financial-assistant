# Personal Finance Assistant

A full-stack personal finance analysis application built with **FastAPI**, **Pandas**, and **SQLite**.  
Users upload a bank transaction CSV and receive structured spending analysis and human-readable financial advice through a web interface.

🔗 **Live Demo:**

_(Free-tier deployment — first load may take ~30 seconds)_

## Overview

This project implements an end-to-end personal finance analysis pipeline exposed through a REST API and a lightweight frontend.

It ingests raw bank transaction CSV exports, cleans and categorizes transactions, persists them into a SQLite database, performs analytical aggregation using Pandas, and generates concise rule-based financial insights.

The goal of the project is to demonstrate:

- data engineering fundamentals
- backend API design
- analytical reasoning
- clean software architecture
- end-to-end deployment

---

## Features

### Backend

- Upload bank CSV files
- Clean and normalize transaction data
- Categorize transactions using rule-based logic
- Persist transactions into SQLite
- Analyze spending by category and by month
- Detect unusually large transactions (outliers)
- Compute income, expenses, and net savings
- Generate human-readable financial advice
- JSON-safe API responses
- Idempotent pipeline execution (`run-all`)
- Optional database reset

### Frontend

- HTML / CSS / JavaScript Two-Page website
- CSV upload
- One-click pipeline execution
- Displays analysis results and advice
- dashboard display based on different time ranges..

### Deployment

- FastAPI backend deployed on Render
- Frontend served by FastAPI
- Public demo URL

## Pipeline Phases

### Phase 1 — Ingestion & Cleaning

- Reads raw bank transaction CSVs
- Normalizes merchant names
- Converts amounts to numeric values
- Computes absolute transaction values
- Assigns spending categories
- Outputs a clean, standardized CSV

### Phase 2 — Persistence

- Stores cleaned transactions in SQLite
- Prevents duplicate inserts via constraints

### Phase 3 — Analysis

- Computes totals and averages by category
- Calculates spending percentages
- Analyzes spending over time
- Identifies unusually large transactions
- Computes monthly cashflow and savings

### Phase 4 — Advice

- Interprets analysis results using rule-based logic
- Produces concise, human-readable insights
- Handles insufficient or partial data gracefully

### Phase 5 — FastAPI

- Exposes the full pipeline via REST endpoints
- Uploads CSV files using multipart form data
- Returns JSON-safe analytical results
- Provides a single `/run-all` endpoint for full execution

### Phase 6 — Frontend

- Lightweight HTML / CSS / JavaScript UI
- Allows CSV upload and DB reset
- Displays analysis output and advice
- Displays charts and time range etiquettes that allow users to choose the range of the data display

### Phase 7 — Deployment

- Deployed on Render (free tier)
- Backend and frontend served together
- Public demo link available

## Input

The application expects a **CSV export from a bank**, typically containing:

- `date`
- `merchant`
- `amount`
- `category` _(optional — inferred if missing)_

Formatting differences are handled during ingestion.

## Notes

- This project is intended for learning and demonstration purposes
- No real personal financial data should be committed
- Free-tier deployments may experience cold starts
